# SAS-Exploratory-Analysis
A Property Developer is planning to build a shopping centre in a small town, which has a large
university student population. Before starting the project, the manager of the (property developer)
company is keen to find out about potential consumers’ attitudes and preferences regarding
particular aspects of shopping centres, e.g. places to sit down, amenities, shops etc. It is hoped
that this will help them make key decisions such as: choosing an appropriate location for the
shopping centre; identifying the potential companies (retailers) that may be interested in renting a
store; designing the centre’s facilities/amenities and layout.

To explore the above issues the Property Developer Company designed a questionnaire (provided
at the end of this document) and distributed it to shoppers in the town centre. The available data
has been provided by the property developer in two data files (available on Learn), each containing
the responses to two different sets of questions (you will have to merge and possibly clean the
data prior to analysing it). Unfortunately, the Company did not spend a lot of time designing the
survey. They merely thought of several features that seemed relevant to them and designed the
questionnaire on this basis. Unsurprisingly, they are now unsure whether and how the data
collected can help them with their planning.

The task was to undertake a statistical analysis of the data provided using SAS Enterprise guide and 
produce a report for the property developer critically discussing the results of the analysis.

# The files included are:
- Original Excel data files
- SAS file containing all the output
- Final report going over the analysis
